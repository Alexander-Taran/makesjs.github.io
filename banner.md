# Banner

Skeleton can provide an optional "banner" file in pure text. This text file will be printed to terminal before "makes" asks the first question.

Two examples:
* [`aurelia/new` `banner`](https://github.com/aurelia/new/blob/master/banner)
* [`dumberjs/new` `banner`](https://github.com/dumberjs/new/blob/master/banner)
